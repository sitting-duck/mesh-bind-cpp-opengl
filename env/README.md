In this dir is the installer for Visual Studio 2013 so that if I ever need to set this project up on a new machine I will always have access to this installer, which by now is pretty dated. 

I was able to install and run this version of Visual Studio on Windows 11. I originally had developed this program on Windows 8. 

The Freeglut libs seem only built in 32 bit debug mode and the website and github for freeglut do offer build instructions but they were a bit difficult to follow. 

I may experiment with the prebuilts that are community maintained if I really want to extend this program in the future.
