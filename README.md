### mesh-bind-cpp-opengl

# Introduction
I wrote this for a Computer Animation course at University of Texas at Dallas in 2013. This project is pretty academeic in the sense that we reinvent the wheel and "roll our own" for many of the components involved in 3D animation. Modern SWE probably would use more pre-built components rather than writing one's own matrix, camera, 3D transformation classes and so on than what is done here. </br>

It's written in C++ and uses OpenGL to create and render scenes, freeglut and glui are used for frontend components. These we just use, we don't reinvent the wheel for the GUI components. The purpose of the project I believe was basically to break down and really understand the components of a 3D engine more or less.
